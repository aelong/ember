    //! 1. Find its range and the range of its derivative.
    //! 2. Apply four criteria and and find where insertions are
    //!    needed. the criteria for a component f(j) are:
    //!      - `|f[j+1]-f[j]| < vtol*range(f)`

    //!      - `1/uniformityTol < hh[j]/hh[j-1] < uniformityTol`
    //! 3. If any of these criteria is not satisfied, a grid point j
    //!    is inserted.
    //!
    //! Next, the unnecessary grid points are removed, and the algorithm is
    //! applied in reverse. If the criteria:
    //!   - `|f[j]-f[j-1]| > rmTol*vtol*range(f)`
